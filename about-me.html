      	<h2>Hello! I'm Emily, and this is my story...</h2>
       	<p>I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. My parents, Amy and Doug Armstrong, my brother, Mark, and I all lived in Ann Arbor when I was growing up. I went through the Ann Arbor public schools, and ended up graduating from Pioneer High School in 2009.</p>
       <p>When I was in High School, there was this amazing social media site called MySpace! Maybe you've heard of it? It was all the rage at the time. Every high school student had it, and the best part was the platform was completely customizable! That is where my love of coding began. I spent a lot of time studying html so I could create my own custom layouts. I would literally create MY space, one that nobody else would own. I would spend hours finding photos and then I would open MS paint, and I would crop and edit photos to make my website exactly how I wanted it. When MySpace eventually died, I figured "my knowledge of html will be useless, everybody knows that stuff right?"</p>
        <p>After high school, I decided to go straight into College. I enrolled at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan.  During the school year, I lived, studied and worked in Big Rapids; during the summer I would come home and work at the nearby McDonalds. I started as a nursing student and spent my first 2 years completing most of my prereqs, my first semester of college I even made the Honor Roll! After those two years, I decided Nursing wasn't my calling and I changed my major to the Early Childhood Education Program. I graduated with my Associate's Degree in 2013 and had a final GPA of 3.68.</p>
       <p>Once I graduated college, I worked as a teacher full time, on and off for a few years; during that time I continued working my part-time job at McDonalds. At McDonalds, I met my now husband, Andrew Lewis. We were Married in 2016, and welcomed our son, Rolan, into the world that same year. When my son was just a few months old, I decided to go back to school and change my career paths.</p>
       <p>I decided to enroll at Washtenaw Community College on a whim. I ended up taking a class in website development. All the memories of those early MySpace days started flooding back to me! Could I really make a living off of this? I decided I wanted to try. I enjoy coding so much, and on top of that, I think I'm good at it. Now, I'm over a year into the program and I still love it just as much, if not more! I love learning new stuff about all aspects of website design and development.</p>
       <p>As of right now, I have completed all of the introduction and basic classes in the Web Design and Development program which includes; Introduction to User Interface Design, Introduction to Web Development, Introduction to Web User Experience, and Intermediate Web Development and Introduction to JavaScript. This semester I am studying Advanced Javanscript, which covers different aspects of Web Application development such as SSH, Git, Node, NPM, and AJAX. I am also taking the Intermediate Web User Experience this semester.</p>
